# Connectivity Test Configuration
# -------------------------------
# This file configures the connectivity_test.sh script.

# Usage:
# 1. IP Addresses (ips):
#    Specify IP addresses to check, along with the check method and port (if applicable).
#    Format: "IP:METHOD:PORT" or "IP:METHOD"
#    - For ping checks: "IP:ping"
#    - For HTTP checks: "IP:http:PORT" (default port is 80 if omitted)
#    - For HTTPS checks: "IP:https:PORT" (default port is 443 if omitted)
#    Example: "192.168.1.1:ping" or "example.com:https:8443"

# 2. Threshold (threshold):
#    Minimum number of reachable devices required to consider the network healthy.

# 3. Interval (interval):
#    Time in seconds between each check cycle.

# 4. Timeout (timeout):
#    Maximum time in seconds to wait for user input before auto-rebooting.

# 5. Debug Mode (debug):
#    Set to 'true' for verbose logging and simulated actions, 'false' for normal operation.
#    When true, the script will:
#    - Log additional debug information
#    - Simulate (pretend) reboots instead of actually rebooting
#    - Simulate service restarts instead of actually restarting services
#    This is useful for testing the script's logic without affecting the system.

# 6. Local Services (local_services):
#    List of local services to monitor and potentially restart.
#    Format: "service_name:check_type[:port]"
#    - check_type can be 'process' (checks if process is running) or 'port' (checks if port is open)
#    - For 'port' checks, specify the port number
#    Example: "ssh:port:22" or "nginx:process"

# Configuration:
ips=(
  "127.0.0.1:ping"
)
threshold=1 # Minimum number of reachable devices to be considered OK
interval=300  # in seconds (5 minutes)
timeout=30   # in seconds
debug=true  # Set to true for debug mode with simulated actions, false for normal operation

# Local services to check
local_services=(
  "ssh:port:22"
  # Add more services as needed, e.g., "nginx:process"
)
